- Have a smooth KYC experience for end users
- Perform industry standard fraud & AML checks on users and transactions

## How to integrate

Rampay provides 3 modes of integration:

### 1. Direct widget integration - Get live quickly in just few lines of code

Embed our widget within your application using an iframe. Customise a lot of things like color theme, default currencies, amount, etc.
For more details on how this integration works, you can follow this Check it out [here](https://docs.rampay.io/integration).
We are constantly adding more customization options to enhance the widget experience for you.

### 2. Complete End to End API Integration (Direct)

Build your own UI and use our APIs to create a user on our end. You can supply user details like address, phone number, name via our APIs and then create an order with this user's context to fix things like wallet address, crypto currency, fiat currency, fiat amount, payment method, etc.
In this flow, all the widget screens are skipped and user sees a final screen to complete the payment.

This is how this flow works,

- Show list of supported [fiat currencies](https://docs.rampay.io/rampay-apis/list-of-fiat-currencies) and [crypto currencies](https://docs.rampay.io/rampay-apis/list-of-crypto-currencies) to your users using the available APIs
- Get [pricing details](https://docs.rampay.io/rampay-apis/pricing) for fiat amount, cryptocurrency and fiat currency.
- [Create a User](https://docs.rampay.io/rampay-apis/create-user) on our end from your backend.
- [Create an order](https://docs.rampay.io/rampay-apis/create-order) from your backend with the user context.
- Send the Order Id along with your API key in the query params like https://exchange-sandbox.rampay.io?orderId=ORDER_ID&apiKey=API_KEY
- Configure webhooks in [partner dashboard](https://partner-sandbox.rampay.io) to get order status updates and get the status of each order using the [GET order API](https://docs.rampay.io/rampay-apis/get-order).

### 3. Lightweight API Integration
